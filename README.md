# DataStudio5

Overview:

For this project my goal was to try something new, and I accomplished that -- even if it wasn't exactly, the ~new~ thing that I originally intended to create.

Once I had my data from the Meyers Abortion Facility Database, I intended to make a form on my html website that let users put in their county and state and it would tell them how far the nearest abortion clininc was. 

This didn't work! So instead I created the antimated gif (see second grapic) and I really like how it came out

All numbers/figures were calculated using pivot tables and sorting through the data from Meyers. I also took inspiration from Politico's coverage of Governor DeSantis and his policies on reprodictive care.
